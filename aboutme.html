    <p>
        My name is Karen Li. I am an undergraduate student, expecting to graduate in December 2021,
        at the University of Oklahoma majoring in Management Information Systems.
        I am orginally from Tulsa, OK.
        I moved to Norman, OK to pursue higher education at the University of Oklahoma. I decided to major in Management
        Information Systems in hopes of combining my love for business and technology.

    <p style="margin-top: 2%;">
        Throughout my years in college, my
        interests in coding and development grew stronger. As well as being involved in several organizations/clubs such as
        Lambda Delta Psi, and the MIS Student Association. This is where I have developed majority of my leadership skills.
        In my free time, I run my own small business where I have learned how to bookkeep and manage finances. My dream is to
        open my own location for my business and land a job in software development or data science while living in a big city.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 2%;">
        My interests include data analytics, data science, web development, and software development. I am constantly looking for
        opportunities to learn and to grow my skills.
